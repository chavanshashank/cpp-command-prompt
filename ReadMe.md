(A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...  nope, not that far.. and not that too long.. only 2013 :D) (Also.. English!! :D )

I have just created the Command Prompt's few commands for my CMD using C++ for mini project. Still, my CMD project is in initial level and I am working to make it more and better.! :) This is the version which compiled using the Borland compiler 5.5?. As we are a bit restricted to use this compiler for our programs. But I am sure it's not very difficult to Convert it into ANSI C++ format. But I will update this project after some days with many new functions of original Command Prompt. You can also download and use it on your computer and if you have any ideas, suggestion or found any bug in my Program you can tell me or Contact me or Comment here.!

Please note that my project is in initial level, its code is not that optimized. But it works seamlessly though.! I will update it further with many new Functions and ANSI C++ standard functions as well. (Update 2019: Nope, not anytime soon :D )
